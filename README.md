Oracle daemon for Lido decentralized staking service. Collects and reports CL states to the Lido dApp contracts running on Ethereum EL side.

There are two types of oracles:
  - **accounting:**
      reports info about validators count, balances (validators, withdrawal vault, EL rewards vault), count of exited validators
  - **ejector:**
      reports info about next validators to be ejected (to initiate exit from CL)

# Usage

## Setup
Oracle daemon must be run using a docker container. Images is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lidofinance/oracle).
Pull the image using the following command:
```bash
docker pull lidofinance/oracle:{tag}
```
Where `{tag}` is a version of the image. You can find the latest version in the [releases](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-oracle/releases)
**OR**\
You can build it locally using the following command:
```bash
docker build -t lidofinance/oracle .
```

## Run
1. Use `.env.example` file content to create your own `.env` file.  
      There are two options to run Oracle:
   - `dry mode` (by default)
   - `production mode` 
\
\
      To run Oracle in `production mode` set `MEMBER_PRIV_KEY` environment variable in `.env` file:
      ```bash
      MEMBER_PRIV_KEY={value}
      ```
      Where `{value}` is a private key of the Oracle member account.
2. Run the container using the following command:
      ```bash
      docker run --env-file .env lidofinance/oracle:{tag} {type}
      ```
      Where
   - `{tag}` is a version of the image. You can find the latest version in the [releases](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-oracle/releases)
   - `{type}` is a type of the Oracle. There are two types of oracles:
      - `accounting`
      - `ejector`
