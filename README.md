Oracle daemon for Lido decentralized staking service: Monitoring the state of the protocol across both layers and submitting regular update reports to the Lido smart contracts.

## How it works

There are two modules in the oracle:

- Accounting
- Ejector

### Accounting module

Accounting module updates the protocol TVL, distributes node-operator rewards, updates information about the number of exited and stuck validators and processes user withdrawal requests.
Also Accounting module makes decision to turn on/off the bunker. 

**Flow**

The oracle work is delineated by time periods called frames. Oracles finalize a report in each frame.
The default Accounting Oracle frame length on mainnet is 225 epochs, which is 24 hours (it could be changed by DAO). 
The frame includes these stages:

- **Waiting** - oracle starts as daemon and wakes up every 12 seconds (by default) in order to find the last finalized slot (ref slot).
  If ref slot missed, Oracle tries to find previous non-missed slot.
- **Data collection**: oracles monitor the state of both the execution and consensus layers and collect the data;
- **Hash consensus**: oracles analyze the data, compile the report and submit its hash to the HashConsensus smart contract;
- **Core update report**: once the quorum of hashes is reached, meaning required number of Oracles submitted the same hash,
  one of the oracles chosen in turn submits the actual report to the AccountingOracle contract, which triggers the core protocol
  state update, including the token rebase, finalization of withdrawal requests, and
  deciding whether to go in the bunker mode.
- **Extra data report**: an additional report carrying additional information. This part is required.
  All node operators rewards are distributed in this phase.

### Ejector module

Ejector module requests Lido validators to eject via events in Execution Layer when the protocol requires additional funds to process user withdrawals.

**Flow**

- Finds out how much ETH is needed to cover withdrawals.
- Predicts mean Lido income into Withdrawal and Execution Rewards Vaults.
- Figures out when the next validator will be withdrawn.
- Encode Lido validators to eject int bytes and send transaction.

# Usage

## Machine requirements

Only Oracle:

- vCPUs - 2
- Memory - 8 GB

Oracle + KAPI:
- vCPU - 4
- Memory - 16 GB

## Dependencies

### Execution Client Node

To prepare the report, Oracle fetches up to 10 days old events, makes historical requests for balance data and makes simulated reports on historical blocks. This requires an [archive](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#archive-node) execution node.
Oracle needs two weeks of archived data.

### Consensus Client Node

Also, to calculate some metrics for bunker mode Oracle needs [archive](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#archive-node) consensus node.

### Keys API Service

This is a separate service that uses Consensus and Execution Clients to fetch all lido keys. It stores the latest state of lido keys in database.

[Lido Keys API repository.](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-keys-api)

## Setup

Oracle daemon could be run using a docker container. Images is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lidofinance/oracle).
Pull the image using the following command:

```bash
docker pull lidofinance/oracle:{tag}
```

Where `{tag}` is a version of the image. You can find the latest version in the [releases](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-oracle/releases)
**OR**\
You can build it locally using the following command (make sure build it from latest [release](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-oracle/releases)):

```bash
docker build -t lidofinance/oracle .
```

Full variables list could be found [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-oracle#env-variables).

## Checks before running

1. Use [.env.example](.env.example) file content to create your own `.env` file.
   Set required values. It will be enough to run the oracle in _check mode_.
2. Check that your environment is ready to run the oracle using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker run -ti --env-file .env --rm lidofinance/oracle:{tag} check
   ```
   If everything is ok, you will see that all required checks are passed
   and your environment is ready to run the oracle.

## Run the oracle
1. By default, the oracle runs in *dry mode*. It means that it will not send any transactions to the Ethereum network.
    To run Oracle in *production mode*, set `MEMBER_PRIV_KEY` or `MEMBER_PRIV_KEY_FILE` environment variable:
    ```
    MEMBER_PRIV_KEY={value}
    ```
    Where `{value}` is a private key of the Oracle member account or:
    ```
    MEMBER_PRIV_KEY_FILE={path}
    ```
    Where `{path}` is a path to the private key of the Oracle member account.
2. Run the container using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env lidofinance/oracle:{tag} {type}
   ```

   Replace `{tag}` with the image version and `{type}` with one of the two types of oracles: accounting or ejector.

> **Note**: of course, you can pass env variables without using `.env` file.
> For example, you can run the container using the following command:
>
> ```bash
> docker run --env EXECUTION_CLIENT_URI={value} --env CONSENSUS_CLIENT_URI={value} --env KEYS_API_URI={value} --env LIDO_LOCATOR_ADDRESS={value} lidofinance/oracle:{tag} {type}
> ```

## Manual mode

Oracle could be executed once in "manual" mode. To do this setup `DAEMON` variable to 'False'.

**Note**: Use `-it` option to run manual mode in Docker container in interactive mode.  
Example `docker run -ti --env-file .env --rm lidofinance/oracle:{tag} {type}`

In this mode Oracle will build report as usual (if contracts are reportable) and before submitting transactions
Oracle will ask for manual input to send transaction.

In manual mode all sleeps are disabled and `ALLOW_REPORTING_IN_BUNKER_MODE` is True.

### Alerts

A few basic alerts, which can be configured in the [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/).

```yaml
groups:
  - name: oracle-alerts

      - alert: AccountBalance
        expr: lido_oracle_account_balance / 10^18 < 1
        for: 10m
        labels:

        annotations:
          summary: "Dangerously low account balance"
          description: "Account balance is less than 1 ETH. Address: {.labels.address}: {.value} ETH"

### Metrics

> **Note**: all metrics are prefixed with `lido_oracle_` by default.

The oracle exposes the following basic metrics:
